- If the OS's iso is stored in the default location /var/notes/lib/images they will be displayed to the right. If your iso is in another location you can click on the "Browse Local" button this will allow you to search the filesystem.

- The the type of OS that is being installed can be set(this allows libvirt to make more intelligent decisions with setting up the virtual hardware). If the OS isn't availabe set it as generic.

- If any of the settings that you made initially need to be changed or hardware added press the "i" (on some distros this will be a lightbulb) button on the ribbon, and this interface allows you to alter/add hardware. For some changes the VM will need to be restarted.
